Team Website

This is the start of the development of the team website

## Coding Guidelines
Please follow for better readability, _we will delete this instruction before deployment_

- always declare doctype as the first line, and include the following
``` 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
``` 
- close all html elements
- attributes must always be encased in double quotes
```  
<p class="attribute"> Hello </p> 
```
- add alt for images as much as possible
``` 
<img src="profile.png" alt="Profile"> 
```


## Additional Reminders
- Download Live server extension for vscode
- Use shift+alt+f in vscode for easier indents
- if possible connect javascript files like this
```
<script defer src="myscript.js">
```
- use dashes for classes similar to bootstrap
```
<p class="large-text"></p>
```

- use camelcase for html id's
```
<p id="importantText"></p>
```
